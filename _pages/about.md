<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [EXiT Lab](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~abatmaz/) at Concordia University, advised by [Dr. Anil Ufuk Batmaz](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~abatmaz/about.html).

My research centers on Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and 3D User Interfaces, focusing on improving user interaction and experience in virtual environments. By integrating methodologies from human-computer interaction (HCI) and immersive technologies, I design, develop, and evaluate interactive VR systems that improve human capabilities in creating, consuming, and interacting with digital content, including video, audio, images, and graphical user interfaces.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Engineer (MLOps) at [Quantigo AI](https://www.quantigo.ai/), where I led a team of four engineer. Before that, I worked as a AI Engineer at [Opus Technolgoy Limited](https://www.opus-bd.com/) and trained an intelligent agent for CS: GO using offline RL technique.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, at Independent University, Bangladesh in 2017. At IUB, I used to work on machine learning, deep leraning, reinforcement learning with [Prof. M. Ashraful Amin](http://www.cse.iub.edu.bd/faculties/25) & [Dr. Amin Ahsan Ali](http://www.cse.iub.edu.bd/faculties/53) at [CCDS](https://ccds.ai).
